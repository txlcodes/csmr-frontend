For a fully functional website, you would need to add the following images to the assets/images folder:

1. csmr-logo.png - A dark blue and white logo for the header
2. csmr-logo-white.png - White version of the logo for the footer
3. hero-bg.jpg - Background image of a university/research setting
4. journal-1.png through journal-4.png - Journal cover images
5. partner-1.png through partner-6.png - Partner institution logos

Since these are placeholder images, you can replace them with real images for the actual website.
