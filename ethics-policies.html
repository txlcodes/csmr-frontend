                        <h3>Originality and Plagiarism</h3>
                        <p>Authors must submit only original work that has not been published or under consideration elsewhere. All sources must be properly cited, and text, data, or ideas borrowed from others must be acknowledged. CSMR uses plagiarism detection software to screen all submissions.</p>

                        <h3>Data Integrity and Fabrication</h3>
                        <p>Authors must present their results clearly, honestly, and without fabrication, falsification, or inappropriate data manipulation. Research methods should be described clearly to allow for replication. When requested, authors should make their data available for verification.</p>

                        <h3>Authorship Criteria</h3>
                        <p>Authorship should be limited to those who have made a significant contribution to the conception, design, execution, or interpretation of the reported study. All those who have made significant contributions should be listed as co-authors. Others who have participated in certain substantive aspects of the research project should be acknowledged or listed as contributors.</p>
                        <p>The corresponding author should ensure that all appropriate co-authors are included on the paper, and that all co-authors have seen and approved the final version of the paper and have agreed to its submission for publication.</p>

                        <p>Authors should not publish manuscripts describing essentially the same research in more than one journal. Submitting the same manuscript to more than one journal concurrently constitutes unethical behavior and is unacceptable.</p>
